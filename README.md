## Abstract
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, educational institutions have moved to online learning, limiting student interaction. SFU Online is a web application designed to connect SFU students, professors, and teaching assistants virtually, compensating for the lack of physical campus interaction. This platform facilitates communication through discussion boards, chat rooms, and group channels, making the online learning experience more interactive and supportive.

## Customer

- **SFU Students:** Especially new students who have missed out on traditional campus experiences.
- **SFU Professors and Teaching Assistants:** To facilitate seamless communication with students.
- **Tutors:** Offering another avenue to assist students in their studies.

- **Exclusivity:** Tailored specifically for interaction within the SFU community.

- **Functionality:** Provides the ability to create and manage channels and chat rooms specifically for academic and social interaction.
