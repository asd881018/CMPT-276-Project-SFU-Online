# Project Proposal

## Introduction

In the event of school being taught online due to Covid-19, students are unable to socialize, form study groups, or make friends during these extremely stressful, overwhelming times. As online learning with little interactive sessions can be considered tough, SFU Online allows students to connect with other students, professors and teaching assistants. This web application brings the SFU community from campus to an online platform where users can easily communicate through features such as discussion boards and chat rooms. 

## Motivation

- Due to covid, students are unable to socialize/ form study groups/ make friends 
- Online learning is already extremely hard on its own (self-teaching, no interactive sessions)
- Extra help may be needed for certain courses / mental health (brings upon tutors)
- World-wide restrictions have made our interpersonal communication skills deteriorate 


## Project Details

**How is this problem solved currently (if at all)?**

- Currently, there are no resources provided by SFU for students to interact
